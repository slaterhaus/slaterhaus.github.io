This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

This project is configured to automatically deploy to Vercel when code is pushed to the master branch.

### Setup Instructions

1. Create a Vercel account and link your GitHub repository
2. Generate a Vercel token from your account settings
3. Add the token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to Secrets and Variables > Actions
   - Create a new repository secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` with your Vercel token as the value

The GitHub Actions workflow will use this token to deploy your application to Vercel whenever changes are pushed to the master branch.

For manual deployment, you can use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
